## HOW to use:

1. Clone or Download this repo to an empty **local** folder of your choosing.
2. From the terminal cd into the newly created folder
3. Make the Start, Stop, and Remove scripts executable.

```BASH
sudo chmod +x Start.sh Stop.sh Remove.sh
```

4. Create a database server ... and connect to database, (Create and connect to new database if it does not exist):
```BASH
./Start.sh
```
5. Stop the database instance and close database connection (SAFE: data will be persisted across complete machine restarts)
```BASH
./Stop.sh
```
6. Remove the datafile permanently (the database will be completely removed)
```BASH
./Remove.sh
```

# NOTE:
> Even if you remove the database, ... a re-run of ./Start.sh will reconstruct the database to it's initial state.
